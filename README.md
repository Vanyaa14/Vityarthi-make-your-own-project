# Features  
<details>  
<summary><strong>Click to Expand Features</strong></summary><br>

### 1. Predicts Patient Survival  
Predicts whether a breast cancer patient is more likely to survive (Alive) or be at high risk (Dead) based on clinical and demographic features.

### 2. Uses a Machine Learning Classifier  
- Logistic Regression model for binary classification (Alive / Dead).  
- Trained on a real breast cancer dataset.

### 3. Handles Categorical Data Automatically  
Uses label encoding to convert text-based clinical features such as:  
- Race  
- Marital Status  
- Tumor Stage (T Stage, N Stage, 6th Stage)  
- Hormone receptor status (Estrogen / Progesterone Status)

### 4. Learns From Realistic Clinical Dataset  
Embedded CSV includes breast cancer records with features like:  
- Age  
- Race  
- Marital Status (Married / Single / Divorced / Widowed etc.)  
- Tumor stages (T, N, 6th Stage)  
- Tumor differentiation and Grade  
- Tumor Size  
- Estrogen & Progesterone Status  
- Lymph node information  
- Survival Months  
- Final Status (Alive / Dead – prediction target)

### 5. Train–Test Split for Fair Evaluation  
Uses `train_test_split` to separate training and testing data, reducing overfitting and enabling unbiased evaluation.

### 6. Predicts New Patient Outcome  
GUI accepts new patient details and instantly predicts:  
- Likely to recover / survive, or  
- High-risk (not likely to survive).

### 7. Input Validation  
- Checks numeric ranges (e.g., valid age, tumor size range).  
- Ensures no empty fields.  
- Ensures categorical values match the training dataset (via dropdowns).

### 8. GUI-Based Clinical Tool  
- Built with Tkinter.  
- Scrollable form for all features.  
- Predict button fixed at the bottom so it is always visible, even when resizing.

### 9. Patient-Friendly Interpretation  
Prediction message is written in clear language so non-technical users (patients, families) can understand the result.

### 10. Supports Real-World Use Cases  
Useful for:  
- Doctors and oncologists (as a decision-support aid).  
- Hospitals and clinics for demo / teaching.  
- Students and researchers learning medical ML and GUI development.
